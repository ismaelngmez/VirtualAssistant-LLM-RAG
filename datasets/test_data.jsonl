{"Question": "How does multiplexing contribute to efficient use of telecommunications resources?", "Answer": "Multiplexing enables the transmission of multiple signals over a single communication channel, thereby optimizing bandwidth usage and allowing for the simultaneous transmission of data, voice, or video signals."}
{"Question": "What are the differences between a LAN and a WAN?", "Answer": "A LAN (Local Area Network) is limited to a small geographical area, such as a building or campus, while a WAN (Wide Area Network) spans larger distances, such as cities or countries, and is typically composed of multiple interconnected LANs."}
{"Question": "What is modulation in telecommunications and what is its purpose?", "Answer": "Modulation is the process of modifying a carrier signal to carry information. Its purpose is to allow information to be efficiently transmitted over different communication mediums, such as cables or the air."}
{"Question": "What role do communication protocols play in computer networks?", "Answer": "Communication protocols are sets of rules and conventions that enable devices on a network to communicate with each other. They establish the format of the data, the sequence of message exchange, and error correction, among other aspects."}
{"Question": "What is network latency and how does it affect the online user experience?", "Answer": "Network latency is the time it takes for a data packet to travel from its source to its destination. It affects the responsiveness of online applications, such as real-time gaming or video calls, as high latency can cause delays and a poor user experience."}
{"Question": "What is a Denial of Service (DoS) attack and how does it work?", "Answer": "A DoS attack aims to overwhelm an online service with malicious traffic, preventing legitimate users from accessing it. This is achieved by sending massive requests from multiple compromised devices, overloading the resources of the target server."}
{"Question": "What is the role of encryption in cybersecurity?", "Answer": "Encryption is the process of converting data into a code to prevent unauthorized access. It plays a critical role in cybersecurity by securing sensitive information, such as personal data or financial transactions, from being intercepted or tampered with by hackers."}
{"Question": "What is social engineering and how does it pose a threat to cybersecurity?", "Answer": "Social engineering is the manipulation of individuals to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise security. It poses a threat by exploiting human psychology, such as trust or curiosity, to gain unauthorized access to systems or data."}
{"Question": "What is malware and what are some common types of malware?", "Answer": "Malware is malicious software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computer systems or data. Common types include viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, and spyware."}
{"Question": "What is multi-factor authentication (MFA) and why is it important for cybersecurity?", "Answer": "Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a security process that requires users to provide two or more forms of verification before accessing an account or system. It's important for cybersecurity because it adds an extra layer of protection beyond just passwords, making it harder for unauthorized users to gain access even if passwords are compromised."}
